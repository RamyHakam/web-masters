# Symfony Course Code Repository

Welcome to the official code repository for our Symfony course! This repository is meticulously organized to enhance your learning experience and ensure you can follow along with each video effortlessly.

## üìö Repository Organization

Our code repository is uniquely structured around **each video number** in the course. This means you can easily find the exact code used in any specific video, allowing for a seamless learning experience.

### üîÑ Resetting to a Specific Video's Code

To help you match your codebase with the one used in any particular video, we've implemented a convenient system of **commits tagged by video number**. Here‚Äôs how you can reset the repository to the state of the code as shown in the video you're currently watching:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (if you haven't already).
2. Use the `git checkout` command followed by the tag corresponding to the video number. For example, to reset to the code used in video 5, you would use:

```bash
git checkout 34e3d5d 
```

This command will switch the state of your code to exactly match what's shown in video 5, ensuring you're always on track.

## üí¨ Discussions and Questions
